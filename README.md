[stanfordrl.github.io/Surreal](https://stanfordrl.github.io/Surreal)

## Goal

- Establish a shared codebase of state-of-the-art algorithm implementations and reusable utilities among Stanford RL group members.

- Accelerate research by ...

	- Providing strong baseline implementation for rapid idea iteration.
	- Reducing potential bug dimensions.
	- Measuring performance in a reproducible fashion.
	- Driving continual improvement of benchmarks.
	- Maintaining readable code for all future publications. 


## Documentation

`gh-pages` branch will host the documentation [webpage](https://stanfordrl.github.io/Surreal).
